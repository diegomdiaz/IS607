Code: select sum(distance) from flights where year= 2013 and tailnum is null;


#3

Q: What is the total distance flown for all planes on July 5, 2013 grouped by aircraft manufacturer? 

A1: Code using INNER JOIN

select manufacturer, sum(distance) from planes inner join flights on planes.tailnum = flights.tailnum where flights.year = 2013 and day = 5 and month = 7 group by manufacturer;

Output

AIRBUS INDUSTRIE	78786
AMERICAN AIRCRAFT INC	2199
BARKER JACK L	937
BOEING	335028
BOMBARDIER INC	31160

A2: code using LEFT OUTER JOIN

select manufacturer, sum(distance) from planes left outer join flights on planes.tailnum = flights.tailnum where flights.year = 2013 and day = 5 and month = 7 group by manufacturer;


Output

Q:Write and answer at least one question of your own choosing that joins information from at least three of the tables in the flights database.

A: Query below reports the types of planes used, by airline, for all flights in December 2013. 

select count(*), airlines.name, planes.type from flights left join planes on flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum 
left join airlines on flights.carrier=airlines.carrier
where flights.year = 2013 and flights.month = 12
group by airlines.name, planes.type;
